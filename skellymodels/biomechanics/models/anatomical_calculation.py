class AnatomicalCalculation(ABC):

    Abstract base class for anatomical calculations.

    Subclasses must implement both a `calculate()` method to produce
    results from an Aspect, and a `store()` method to write those
    results back into the Aspect.

    Example implementations include:
    - Center of mass estimation
    - Rigid body reconstruction
    - Segment angle derivation

        Parameters
        ----------
        aspect : Aspect
            The anatomical data container to operate on.

        Returns
        -------
